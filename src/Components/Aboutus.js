<h1 className="greeting">Greetings to all of my potential clients!</h1>
<p className="glad">Glad to introduced myself. I have graduated from university in Australia. Having a vast corporate experience of more than 20 years globally. Currently, I am working as an Immigration and Education Consultant as well as English instructor at my venture Sole Solutions Education & Immigration Consultancy (SSEIC).
For every student in the developing world, studying abroad is a very crucial decision. It is imperative that they should seek out sound and sufficient advice, else risk jeopardizing their future. Similarly, students and professionals from different background interested to apply for immigration also requires expert opinion for their prompt swift pathways.
Vitally, an individual must choose an academic and immigration service provider with a proven track record. Here at Sole Solutions, our vision is to evaluate each student/professional’ strengths and limitations, and guide them towards the most appropriate institution/program, which, in turn, would enhance their social and academic skills and ultimately help jumpstart their future endeavors.
</p>
<p className="glad1">Since, because of my extreme passion for teaching, I got my Cambridge CELTA teaching certificate and British Council and PTE certification. I have been teaching for different ages of students with verity levels of learners including General English, IELTS, PTE, TOEFL iBT, Duolingo and Business communications. In my view, learning language should be a fun activity, which is why I always use communicative approach in my classes. I have worked for several learning platforms as a visiting faculty to serve my attributes.
SSEIC has a demonstrated history of responsible business conduct. We strongly believe that real business success is not just about profits measured in numbers but also, as importantly, about how those numbers are achieved. Our corporate strategy reflects our commitment to sustainable business practices and balancing responsibility alongside growth and productivity.
Continuing to grow in size with business aassociates in the Canada and moving forward planning to expand our business domain locally. SSEIC began its journey in 2000 from a small office, and today with the blessing of Almighty, we are now established brand in the field of stated expertise.
SSEIC also proud of the fact that our success rates for student visa applications throughout our operations remain above 95% which clearly reflects the quality of our applications and our intention to only accept & process genuine students.
Finally, let me assure all my students and partners that our goals remain constant, we would like to provide the ideal fit for our respective clients with our valuable partners, leading to brighter future prospects. Feel free to contact us anytime for all your Education & Migration solutions.</p>
